first CTRL + F in Main.cpp and find:
case ENET_EVENT_TYPE_RECEIVE:

then under that

ENetPeer* peer = event.peer;
if(peer->incomingDataTotal > 5000) break;

put this. then everything is done.
NOTE: IF THERE IS ENetPeer* peer = event.peer; UNDER THE CODE YOU PASTED DELETE IT

and in GTOS source, code will be like:

case ENET_EVENT_TYPE_RECEIVE:
{
ENetPeer* peer = event.peer;
if(peer->incomingDataTotal > 5000) break;


You can set the limit by your server online if it's giving you a lot trouble,
but recommended is 5000 as it's given.
This code can block CPPBOT packet spammer and sebia's proxy.
That's all for today, don't let people crash your server.
